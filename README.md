# Task 1: Calculator

## Objective  
Build a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and gives a user-friendly interactive interface.

## Steps Performed  
- Created the HTML structure: display screen and buttons grid.  
- Applied CSS Grid to align buttons evenly and styled them using pastel theme.  
- Added JavaScript logic to handle input, operators, calculations (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `%`), clear and delete functions.  
- Implemented visual feedback: hover effects, pressed button animations.  
- Ensured responsiveness so the calculator works on both desktop and mobile.

## Tools Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, animations)  
- JavaScript

## Outcome  
A clean and visually appealing calculator web app that functions correctly for basic arithmetic operations, uses pastel colours for aesthetic consistency, and adapts to screen size. This task provided a good foundation in layout, styling and core JavaScript.
